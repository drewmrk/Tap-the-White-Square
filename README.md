# Tap the White Square

## A Small exercise in TypeScript

### About

This was just a small TypeScript React game I decided to create. There are a few bugs that may or may not get fixed. For example, there is a bug where multiple events can get assigned to one slot, however instead of fixing it, I let it be and considered it to be a random multiplier effect.
